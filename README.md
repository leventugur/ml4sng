# ML4SNG: Machine Learning Enhanced Stochastic Noise Generation (SNG) Project


**ML4SNG Project** aims to enhance the SNG method predictions by using machine learning techniques to reconstruct 
turbulent velocity field from steady flow field properties so that the farfield noise prediction can be performed
based on the generated turbulent flow field.

## ml4sng

To perform the operations in the project framework, a Python package, **ml4sng** has been developed. The source codes, tests and 
setup instructions can be found in [ml4sng](ml4sng).


## Interactive Research

[Jupyter Notebooks](notebooks) have been prepared to illustrate a sample application in an interactive approach. The data used in the sample application can be found in a shared [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10XRzQrzmr-AJfS2Bj0aKihWB0RgXPsAX).


## Documentation

Automatic code documentation has been employed in HTML format. The documentation includes Quickstart, Installation, Tutorial, Theory, Code Documentation and Citation information. 

Since the repository is currently private, the rendered documentation is not included in a public page but it can be reached through GitHub artifacts.

To reach the documentation one can follow the following path:

1. Go to *Actions* section.
2. Open latest *Sphinx* workflow.
3. Download *html-docs* artifact.
4. Open *index.html* file.


## Outcomes of the Study

The reports and presentation files of the project are shared in [Reports](reports) folder.

Addition to reports. The trained neural network model and fitted scaler for features and labels are provided [here](trained_ml_model). The full dataset used in training is located in the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10XRzQrzmr-AJfS2Bj0aKihWB0RgXPsAX).
